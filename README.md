# Hello---World
My name is Jeremiah Masime, a PhD chemistry and a Lecturer at the Technical University of Kenya in the Department of Chemical Sciences and Technology.   Our project is to characterize a synthesized nanocatalyst from eggshells. We have TEM &amp; TEM electron diffraction images from South Africa and XRD spectrum in Kenya, and we have also been able to do the BET and SEM analysis, but our major challenge currently is in obtaining a software that can assist us in the crystallographic analysis (phase analysis, particle size, Crystal type, Kikuchi lines and analysis etc). using the TEM electron diffraction images. Apart from that, I am also interested in software that can assist us in putting the images together. Kindly, Is there a way you can assist?
